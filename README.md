# Special-Education-PTA-of-Yonkers---Mobile-App
From June 2014 - May 2016, I collaborated in a four-person team utilizing an Android-based platform with Java to construct a mobile app for Special Education PTA of Yonkers (SEPTA) that improves retention of information on SEPTA, its membership, and communication among its members.
